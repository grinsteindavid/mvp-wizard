# React Web App Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle: each component should do one thing well
- Create small, reusable components with clear interfaces
- Separate presentational and container components
- Use React hooks for stateful logic
- Keep component files under 300 lines of code

## File Organization
- Group by feature or route instead of type
- Use index.js files for cleaner imports
- Consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Keep related files close to each other
- Organize CSS/styled-components near their components
- Separate utilities, schemas, and services into dedicated directories
- Each component or module has its own test file in the same directory
  Example:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  │    ├── Button/
  │    │    ├── Button.tsx
  │    │    ├── Button.test.tsx  // Unit test
  │    │    ├── Button.module.css
  
- Use barrel exports for cleaner imports

## Code Separation
- Utils: Pure functions for data manipulation and calculations
- Schemas: Validation schemas separate from components
- Services: API calls and external integrations
- Hooks: Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Constants: Application-wide constants and configuration
- Types: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- Styles: Theme configurations and global styles
- Tests: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for pure functional components
- React Hook "useMemo" is should not be called conditionally
- Implement useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
- Apply useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use lazy loading and code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense
- Virtualize long lists with react-window or react-virtualized
- Implement proper key usage in lists
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by managing state properly
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement proper code splitting by routes and features
- Be mindful of potential memory overhead
- Avoid console.log statements in production code
- Be conscious of performance implications when using timers

## State Management
- Use Context API for global state that changes infrequently
- Consider Redux for complex state with many updates
- Keep state as local as possible
- Normalize complex state objects
- Use immutable state updates
- Implement state machines for complex UI flows
- Consider using Redux Toolkit for simpler Redux setup

## Form Handling & Validation
- Implement Joi validations in a separate validation service
- Create reusable validation schemas
- Validate both client-side and server-side
- Use Formik or react-hook-form for complex forms
- Provide immediate feedback for validation errors
- Debounce validation for better UX
- Separate form logic from UI components

## Styling
- Use CSS-in-JS (styled-components) for component-scoped styles
- Implement a consistent theme system
- Create a design system with reusable UI components
- Use CSS variables for theme values
- Consider responsive design from the start
- Implement dark mode and accessibility themes
- Create mixins for common style patterns

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test components with React Testing Library
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Use mock service workers for API testing
- Maintain high test coverage for critical paths
- Use snapshot testing sparingly
- Create test utilities for common testing patterns
- Implement E2E tests with playwright for critical paths

## Build & Deployment
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Enable tree shaking
- Set up proper caching strategies
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Configure proper error monitoring and logging
- Use CDN for static assets

## Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA attributes where needed
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Implement focus management for modals and dialogs
- Create accessible form components
